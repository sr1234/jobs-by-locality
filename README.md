# jobs-by-locality
Job search app built with Expo XDE in React Native

Built this as part of an advanced React Native course by instructor Stephen Grider on Udemy.

You will need to install the Expo XDE if you want to play with the completed code, along with signing up for an Indeed API key.

You'll also need to setup an FB App and supply it's token.

Todo:
- add ability to specify any city
- add ability to change job search keywords
